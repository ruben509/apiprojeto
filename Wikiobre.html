        <div class="a-flex1">Wikipedia is an online free-content encyclopedia project helping
            to create a world in which everyone can freely share in the sum of all knowledge. It is supporte
            d by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of freely editable content. The name Wikipedia is a blending of the words 
            wiki (a technology for creating collaborative websites, from the Hawaiian word wiki, meaning quick) and encyclopedia. Wikipedia articles provide links 
            designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.

                The fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the five pillars.
                The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia;
                however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.
